Volumes :
	The recommended way to persist data, stored at /var/lib/docker/volumes/

Bind Mounts:
	Have limited functionality and you must use the exact file path o the host; volumes recommended
	
TMPFS Mounts:
Stored only in a host's memory in linux

Block Storage:
	Fixed chunks of data
	No metadata is stored
	Best for I/O intensive apps
	SAN storage uses block storage protocols like iSCSI
	
Object Storage :
	Data is stored with metadata and a unique identifier
	There is no organization to the objects
	Scalability is limitless
	Accessed with HTTP calls
	Amazon S3 is an example
	

Docker uses storage driver to manage the contents of the image laymers and the writable container layer. 
Each storage driver handles the implementation differently, but all drives use stackable image layers and the copy-on-write(COW)strategy

https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/

Storage Driver: 
STORAGE drivers are sometime known as Graph drivers. the proper storage driver to use often depends on your operating system and other local configuration factors.
Overlay2: Current ubuntu and Centos/RHEL version
aufs: ubuntu 14.04 and older
devicemaper: centos and earlier.

Storage Models: Persistent data can be managed using several storage models.
Filesystem storage:
	Data is stored in the form of a  file system.
	Used by overlay2 and aufs.
	Efficient use of memory.
	Inefficient with write-heavy workloads.
Blockstorage:
	Storage data in blocks.
	used by divicemapper.
	Efficient with write-heavy workloads.
Object storage:
	Stores data in an external object-based store.
	Application must be designed to use object-based storeage.
	Flexible and scalable.
