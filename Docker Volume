Volumes :
	The recommended way to persist data, stored at /var/lib/docker/volumes/

Bind Mounts:
	Have limited functionality and you must use the exact file path o the host; volumes recommended
	
TMPFS Mounts:
Stored only in a host's memory in linux

Block Storage:
	Fixed chunks of data
	No metadata is stored
	Best for I/O intensive apps
	SAN storage uses block storage protocols like iSCSI
	
Object Storage :
	Data is stored with metadata and a unique identifier
	There is no organization to the objects
	Scalability is limitless
	Accessed with HTTP calls
	Amazon S3 is an example
	

Docker uses storage driver to manage the contents of the image laymers and the writable container layer. 
Each storage driver handles the implementation differently, but all drives use stackable image layers and the copy-on-write(COW)strategy
